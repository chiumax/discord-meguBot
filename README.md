A discord bot inspired by the amazing Arch Wizard of the Crimson Wizard Clan, Megumin! From the anime, Konosuba.

The bot was built off of discord.js.

Thanks for checking out my repo.

If you have any suggestions on making this project any better I'd appreciate it.

Please create an issue if something wrong happens.

## Current Features :statue_of_liberty:

-   Using the selenium module for python to extract quotes from [animecharactersdatabase](https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com)

## Installation

1.  Install Node.JS
2.  Clone/Download repository
3.  Inside directory, use ubuntu terminal. `sudo npm install` to install dependencies
4.  Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
5.  Create an application
6.  Navigate to the `Bot` section located in the sidebar
7.  Copy your bot token
8.  Set a profile pic (The one I used is linked above under resources)
9.  Go to config folder and create a file with the name `token.json`

```
{
    'token': 'paste token here'
}
```

10. Paste the above into your `token.json` file.
11. Invite your bot to discord using this link: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html NOTE: Make sure you copy your client ID which can be found under `general information` where you got your token.
12. Navigate to the directory in your ubuntu terminal and run `node src/index.js`
13. If a season three of Konosuba does come out, make sure to run the python script to update the current list of Megumin quotes. A chrome window will open. Since I'm a beginner and I don't know much about webscraping, a chrome window will open and proceed to look through the website.  **Make sure you have chrome installed on your computer**

13.5. The owner of the anime character database recently hooked me up with this: https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/api.php?srt_lines=1&cid=75490 . If anyone wants to, they can implement this to the script rather than web scraping.
