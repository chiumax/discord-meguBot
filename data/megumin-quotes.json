	"Seems you're out of luck.",
	"Impossible.",

	"That means weapons won't work very well.",
	"My magic should be more effective.",

	"Will Aqua be all right?",
	"I get the feeling she'll bring\nback some insane quest.",
	"Seems that way.",
	"What sort of impression\ndo you two have of me?!",
	"My ultimate explosion magic isn't to be",
	"used on the likes of mere alligators.",
	"Sounds like she's doing fine.",
	"By the way, crimson demons don't\ngo to the bathroom, either.",
	"Please don't!",
	"Crimson demons really don't\nuse the bathroom, okay?",
	"But I'll apologize, so please don't do that.",
	"Still, the alligators aren't coming.",
	"It would be great if this kept up\nand things ended peacefully...",
	"It looks like the purification is complete.",
	"All of the alligators appear to have left, too.",
	"Th-That's right! You did all\nthe work this time, after all!",
	"She's completely holed herself up in there.",
	"Seriously?",
	"He's kind of making me want to blow him up.",
	"Can I blow him up? Can I blow him up?",
	"I wonder what happened.",
	"First,",
	"there's the matter of the cursed sword\nno longer being in his possession.",
	"Did you dream that?",
	"Ow!",
	"That's not it! Please hear me out!",
	"Until now, I've been able to settle for\nunleashing my magic on empty plains,",
	"but since I learned the allure of using\nmagic attacks on a castle, well...",
	"Now I need something big and\nhard, or I just can't endure it.",
	"But when they're all scattered like that...",
	"R-Roger!",
	"What an ideal situation!",
	"I'm grateful! I'm deeply grateful, Kazuma!",
	"My name is Megumin!",
	"I am a user of the finest magic\ncrimson demons possess,",
	"and I command explosion magic.",
	"Behold my power!",
	"Explosion!",
	"It appears every last person\nhere has been left speechless",
	"after witnessing my explosion magic.",
	"That felt amazing...",
	"P-Please.",
	"Grr.",
	"I'm sorry.",
	"Please remember those people's faces for me.",
	"I'll blow them all away later.",
	"Oh?",
	"Darkness, what are you doing?",
	"I've been waiting for you, Kazuma!",
	"Listen to this!",
	"Darkness is being super stingy and\ntelling me I'm too young to have any!",
	"Th-Three hundred million?!",
	"It bothers me, too.",
	"I'm going to join you, defeat the Devil King,",
	"and earn the title of strongest magician.",
	"Our bloody journey of magic",
	"has only just begun.",
	"My name is Megumin.\nI leave this record to pass down tales of my great exploits to future generations.\nThe mighty magic power of the extraordinary magician Megumin\nmade the Devil King's army tremble in fear.\nThe people she has saved revered her from the bottoms of their hearts,\nand all the children were entranced by her.\nThere was a flood of fans waiting for her at the guild,\nenough that she could have handed out numbered tickets.\n-Written Preface of the Great Magician",
	"Do we have some nice job lined up?",
	"The reward for fighting off a\nleader in the Devil King's army",
	"was distributed to every\nadventurer who participated.",
	"There's no reason for anyone to go\nhunting dangerous winter monsters",
	"when their coin pouches are full.",
	"I gladly welcome it, personally.",
	"Kazuma, Kazuma!",
	"How about this?",
	"A kill quest for a One-Shot Bear!",
	"Now is the time for me to\nteach it which of us has",
	"the stronger one-shot attack\nwith my explosion magic!",
	"It lumbers around, trampling everything.",
	"It's oddly popular with children.",
	"There are lots of Snow\nSprites in the snowy plains.",
	"It's said that spring will come half a\nday sooner for every one you kill.",
	"They're very weak monsters,\nso they're easily defeated, but...",
	"Kazuma!",
	"Can I blow away all the ones in\nthe area with explosion magic?",
	"Roger!",
	"By my efflux of deep crimson,",
	"topple this white world!",
	"Explosion!",
	"I got eight of them.",
	"That makes nine defeated Snow Sprites total.",
	"I even went up a level.",
	"...zuma! Kazuma, please wake up!",
	"Kazuma!",
	"Kazuma!",
	"How do you feel?",
	"Do you feel strang in any way?",
	"You are?",
	"You were killed in such a\nterrible way, after all...",
	"A Snow Sprite?",
	"Do Snow Sprites eat anything to begin with?",
	"Actually, I've worked up an appetite.",
	"Once you become as great a magician as I am,",
	"you require great sacrifices\nin order to function.",
	"This was originally some\naristocrat's villa, I hear.",
	"I'm the one who should be saying that!",
	"Why did you come barging into this room?",
	"I thought Aqua was coming back.",
	"Well, there were dolls moving\naround all over the place...",
	"So, um, I was going to have Aqua protect me...",
	"and thought we could go\nto the bathroom together.",
	"Is she? I'm sure Darkness is with her, then.",
	"I won't let you.",
	"How can you try to relieve yourself alone?",
	"Aren't we allies?",
	"Wherever we go, bathroom or otherwise,",
	"we go together!",
	"You just blurted out something outrageous!",
	"What are you suggesting I\ndo with that empty bottle?!",
	"I won't let you!",
	"I can at least shake you from behind",
	"while you're taking of your business\u2014",
	"Kazuma, are you there?",
	"Are you really there?",
	"You're really, really there for me, right?",
	"Um, this is a little embarrassing,",
	"so could you sing a song or\nsomething in a loud voice?",
	"Please don't rush me like that!",
	"I know you're in a tough spot, too!",
	"I can't go if you rush me like that!",
	"How can anyone have so\nlittle common sense?!",
	"What are you talking about?",
	"Crimson demons don't use the bathroom.",
	"I thought that might happen, so I brought this.",
	"Please use it.",
	"Darkness blacker than black\nand darker than dark,",
	"I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.",
	"Darkness! That's not fair!",
	"All right, then... Very well, very well.",
	"Go ahead and do as you please.",
	"Looks like my only choice now is\nto whip out my deadly teleport.",
	"Those are the rules.",
	"Destroyer, explosion!",
	"I can hardly believe I'm laying\nmy eyes on marbled red crab!",
	"I've never been more glad that\nI joined this party than I am today.",
	"Of course!",
	"If you told me I could eat this crab",
	"in exchange for holding off on\nusing explosion magic for the day,",
	"I would restrain myself with pleasure,",
	"and unleash my explosion\nmagic after I've eaten!",
	"That's how luxurious it is!",
	"Yeah!",
	"Aqua, Aqua, what does it taste like?",
	"Please give me some, too!",
	"Just for today! What can it hurt?",
	"Th-The form, shape, and movements!",
	"It's the Destroyer for sure!",
	"Aqua, do it again! Do it again!",
	"Just be good and let us destroy you.",
	"Are you insane, Kazuma?",
	"Kazuma, she may be cute, but she's still a devil,",
	"a monster.",
	"Have you gone mad?",
	"The succubus ran away, huh?",
	"The mobile fortress, Destroyer...",
	"Fighting that thing is reckless, at best.",
	"Hey, wait!",
	"If you're talking about me,\ndon't call me by that nickname!",
	"Otherwise, I'll prove just how crazy I am",
	"right here and now!",
	"I don't think even my explosion magic\ncan take it down in a single blow.",
	"I'm okay. I am strong. I am strong.",
	"I am the finest of crimson\ndemons, a genius magician...",
	"I-I'll blow... blow it away\nwith my explosion magic!",
	"What was that?!",
	"You just said the one thing",
	"you must never say to me,\neven worse than mocking my name!",
	"I'll show you what real explosion magic is!",
	"Darkness blacker than black\nand darker than dark,",
	"I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.",
	"The time of awakening cometh.",

	"That's a lich for you.\nHer level far exceeds my own.",
	"How frustrating...",
	"The star takes the stage.",
	"I fell behind earlier, but that was... Yes!",
	"I just felt slightly under the weather!",
	"I shall show you true explosion magic!",
	"I'm ready anytime.",
	"I can't believe I get to use\nexplosion magic twice in a day\u2014",
	"What're you doing out of nowhere?",
	"I thought my heart was going to stop!",
	"What is it? Is this sexual harassment?",
	"You're sexually harassing me\nin this state of emergency?!",
	"I feel it, I feel it!",
	"I should be able to fire the highest\ngrade of explosion magic with this.",
	"A little more... Just a little more.",
	"This could be terrific. It's terrific.",
	"Oh, blackness shrouded in light...",
	"Frenzied blaze clad in night...",
	"All else aside,",
	"I don't want to be outdone by anyone else",
	"when it comes to explosion magic!",
